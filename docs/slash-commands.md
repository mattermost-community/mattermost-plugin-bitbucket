/bitbucket subscribe mattermost/mattermost-server issues,pulls,issue_comments
Get to do items - Use /bitbucket todo to get an ephemeral message with items to do in Bitbucket, including a list of assigned issues and pull requests awaiting your review.
Update settings - Use /bitbucket settings to update your settings for notifications and daily reminders.
And more! - Run /bitbucket help to see what else the slash command can do.
