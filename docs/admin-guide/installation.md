# Installation

## Marketplace Installation

1. Go to **Main Menu &gt; Plugin Marketplace** in Mattermost.
2. Search for "Bitbucket" or find the plugin from the list.
3. Select **Install**.
4. When the plugin has downloaded and been installed, select **Configure**.

## Manual Installation

If your server doesn't have access to the internet, you can download the latest [plugin binary release](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-bitbucket/releases) and upload it to your server via **System Console &gt; Plugin Management**. The releases on this page are the same used by the Marketplace. To learn more about how to upload a plugin, see [the documentation](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/plugins.html#plugin-uploads).
